# WaterSensor

A modular System to check water quality. It will follow the eurbox norm, so all modules can be easily transported after construction.

## Conductivity

The first module which is WIP aims to measure the conductivity of water via the 4-point method.

Currently the cad model is worked on, after finishing this it will be equiped with an ESP D1 Mini, of which if possible the adc ports will be utilized to measure $I$ and $U$.
